# StockSims
## A basic stock trading simulator 
Hi there! My name is Chao, a Junior Front-End Web Developer currently working with CodeKentucky on a Capstone Project. The objective of this project is to reinforce and showcase some of the technical skills I've acquired throughout this 28 week bootcamp program. 

My website, StockSims, is a fictional website composed of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. StockSims will soon integrate and incorporate Express JS and MongoDB Atlas as an back-end server and data storage. The requirements for the capstone project or focused features are listed below:

- Must have a responsive design through the use of media queries, CSS Grid, Flexbox, and/or other similar approaches
- Minimum of 5 GitGub repository commits
- Includes a README file
- Minimum of 3 features from the features list:
  - Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app.
    - A nested array of objects is utilized to store key-value pairs to be generated into the Current Positions Table.
  - Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event).
    - A char counter is incorporated  and displayed on the Feedback to inform user of how close they are to the 600 character maximum. 
  - Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
    - Search and Refresh buttons utilizes a fetch to third-party API to retrieve data and renders it into a HTML table
  - Additional features:
    - Create a function that accepts two or more input parameters and returns a value that is calculated or determined by the inputs.  Basic math functions donâ€™t count (e.g. addition, etc).
        - AddPosition function takes in four parameters and generates an object array to be integrated into a HTML table.

To begin, start by opening the index.html file with a code editer such as Visual Studio Code and preview in a live server. Once the live section is started, you can begin by inputting some user information. The input data will be auto generated into the Feedback form (as of right now, this section is used primarily as a placeholder and will later be upgraded into a log in section). The search section will currently accept all publicly listed company (stocks and ETFs traded on the major exchanges). A full list can be founded on https://www.stockdata.org/search which is the third party API that is integrated. NOTE: The free subsciption which is what StockSims utilizes is limited to 100 requests daily. 

This website is an ongoing project and will continue to have updates as I further pursue HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other frameworks. Some features of the web application are still under construction such as the options for limit orders, dollar based orders, and the Feedback form. The website will continue to be updated as I incorporate Express JS and MongoDB in the very near future. 

If you have any feedback or suggestions on how to improve the website or code, don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks for visiting!
